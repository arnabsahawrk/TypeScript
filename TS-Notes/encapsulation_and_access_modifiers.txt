*4 keys of OOP: Inheritance, Abstraction, Encapsulation, Polymorphism.

*Encapsulation helps us to manage the visibility of class members.

*Access modifiers: public, private, protected, readonly

//by default the is public, can access from everything

//protected modifiers can access from only inheritance class

//private modifiers can access from nowhere

//readonly modifiers can read only but can't modify the value.
